📘 JavaScript Level-1 Projects (1–5)

This repository contains my first 5 JavaScript beginner-friendly projects, focused on core logic and fundamental programming concepts.
These projects are part of a structured 50-project JS roadmap.

📂 Projects Included
1️⃣ Multiplication Table Generator

Takes a number from the user

Prints the multiplication table from 1 to 10

Uses loops and basic number operations

2️⃣ Palindrome Checker

Checks if a number or string reads the same backward

Uses remainder logic / string reverse logic

Great for understanding loops and conditions

3️⃣ Factorial Finder

Calculates factorial of a number

Practices iterative logic and multiplication loops

4️⃣ Random Quote Generator

Displays a random quote from an array

Uses Math.random() and DOM manipulation

5️⃣ Word Counter Tool

Counts words and characters from a textarea input

Useful string trimming and splitting logic

🛠 Technologies Used

JavaScript (ES6+)
